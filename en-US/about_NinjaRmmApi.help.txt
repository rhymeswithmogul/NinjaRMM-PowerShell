SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A PowerShell module to interact with the NinjaRMM API.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell module allows you to interact with the NinjaRMM Public API.
    This module implements version 0.1.2 of their API.

Legal Disclaimers
    This module is in NO WAY associated with, affiliated with, developed by, or
    endorsed by NinjaRMM, LLC.

    You also use this module at your own risk.  I am not responsible if running
    NinjaRmmApi somehow breaks your NinjaRMM deployment, makes your lunch taste
    bad, or otherwise ruins your day.

Getting an API Key
    To get started with this module, log into NinjaRMM, then click here:
    https://app.ninjarmm.com/#/configuration/integrations/api

    (Or, to get there yourself, log in and go to your dashboard. Then, click on
    Configuration, Integrations, then API.)

    Up in the top-right corner is a link that says "Generate API Key." Click it
    and give your key a descriptive name.  Write down the access key ID and the
    secret access key.  You will not the latter again!

    Then, in your PowerShell session, call Set-NinjaRmmSecrets to store the API
    information:

    PS C:\> Set-NinjaRmmSecrets -AccessKeyID "TF4STGMDR4H7AEXAMPLE" `
    >> -SecretAccessKey "eh14c4ngchhu6283he03j6o7ar2fcuca0example"

    With that out of the way, it's time to do something actually fun.

Getting Customers
    You can look up customer information with the Get-NinjaRmmCustomers cmdlet.
    With no arguments, it returns a list of all customers. You can also use the
    -CustomerID parameter to fetch a specific customer.

    The NinjaRMM API returns your results as native PowerShell objects. Because
    of this, you can query and manipulate your data with native cmdlets such as
    Format-List, Where-Object, and Select-Object (and of course, Out-GridView):

    PS C:\> Get-NinjaRmmCustomers -CustomerID 42
    
    id name         description
    -- ----         -----------
    42 Deep Thought

    PS C:\> (Get-NinjaRmmCustomers -CustomerID 42).name
    
    Deep Thought

Getting Devices
    You can get devices in the same manner, by using Get-NinjaRmmDevices:

    PS C:\> $myComputer = Get-NinjaRmmDevices -DeviceID 528
    PS C:\> $myComputer.System | Format-List
    
    manufacturer       : Hewlett-Packard
    name               : RECEPTION-PC
    model              : HP Z400 Workstation
    dns_host_name      : Reception-PC
    bios_serial_number : 2UA1234567
    serial_number      : 2UA1234567
    domain             : WORKGROUP

Working with Alerts
    You can get and reset alerts, too.  The syntax should look very familiar by
    this point.

    PS C:\> $alertsToReviewLater = Get-NinjaRmmAlerts -Since 3071641
    
    PS C:\> Reset-NinjaRmmAlert -AlertID 3071642

EXAMPLES
    A quick example session with NinjaRmmApi might look something like this:

      PS C:\> Set-NinjaRmmSecrets -AccessKeyID $myKeyID -SecretAccessKey $mySAK
      PS C:\> $alerts = Get-NinjaRmmAlerts
      PS C:\> Reset-NinjaRmmSecrets

    Firstly, we put the NinjaRMM API key information into memory.  Assume that,
    for the sake of this example, those two variables contain your actual keys.

    Then, you are able to run any of the cmdlets in this module.  The next line
    saves all alerts to the variable $alerts, which you can work with later.

    Finally, when you're finished making API calls, it is prudent to remove the
    secrets from memory.

NOTE
    Your NinjaRMM API keys are stored in cleartext in the system's environment.
    It is wholly possible that another process running on this system could see
    your access key ID and secret access key. Thus, it is good practice to call
    Reset-NinjaRmmSecrets when you are finished working.

    This module does not store your API key information across sessions. If you
    need long-term storage for your key material, consider saving it to a file,
    copying and pasting it from a password manager, adding it to your $Profile,
    or storing it with the SecretManagement module.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    This module does not do error checking. NinjaRMM's API will return an error
    code to the error stream, but that cannot be tested easily. You may wish to
    write your code like this:

    $result = Get-NinjaRmmCustomer -CustomerId 42
    If ($null -eq $result) { 
        # something bad happened
    } Else {
        # do stuff
    }
