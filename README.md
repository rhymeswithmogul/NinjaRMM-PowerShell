# THIS PROJECT IS DEAD, BUT YOU CAN STILL FORK IT
I've changed jobs, and I no longer have access to NinjaRMM.  This module implemented version 0.x of the API, which I'm told is long dead.  Fork this project and keep it alive!  This repo and module will remain for historical purposes.

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/rhymeswithmogul/NinjaRMM-PowerShell/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) 

A PowerShell module to interact with [the NinjaRMM Public API](https://www.ninjarmm.com/dev-api/).  This currently complies with [beta version 0.1.2 of the specification](https://ninjaresources.s3.amazonaws.com/PublicApi/0.1.2/NinjaRMM%20Public%20API%20v0.1.2.pdf).

## Installing this module
This module is available in [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NinjaRmmApi):
```powershell
PS C:\> Install-Module NinjaRmmApi
```
Or, download it from here and save all of the files somewhere in your `$PSModulePath`.

## Before you start
To get started with this module, you will need to log into your dashboard and [request an API key](https://app.ninjarmm.com/#/configuration/integrations/api).  Write down the access key ID and the secret access key.  You will not see them again!

Then, in your PowerShell session, teach it your secrets with `Set-NinjaRmmSecrets`.
```powershell
PS C:\> Set-NinjaRmmSecrets -AccessKeyID "TF4STGMDR4H7AEXAMPLE" -SecretAccessKey "eh14c4ngchhu6283he03j6o7ar2fcuca0example"
```
You will need to do this every time you start a new PowerShell session;  this module does *not* store your keys for you!  For long-term storage, consider using a password manager, sticking the keys in your `$Profile` file, or using the [SecretManagement module](https://github.com/powershell/secretmanagement).  How you do this is an exercise left to the reader.

## Using this module
Now that that's been done, start using their API!

### Customers
You can look up customer information with the `Get-NinjaRmmCustomers` cmdlet.  With no arguments, it returns a list of all customers.  You can also use the -CustomerID parameter to fetch a specific customer.  The NinjaRMM API returns data as objects that you can parse with other PowerShell cmdlets like `Format-List` and `Select-Object` (and, of course, everyone's favorite, `Out-GridView`!).
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-NinjaRmmCustomers -CustomerID 42

id name         description
-- ----         --------------
42 Deep Thought Bring a towel.
```

### Devices
You can get devices in the same manner, by using `Get-NinjaRmmDevices`.  Again, your results are PowerShell objects that you can work with.
```powershell
PS C:\> $myComputer = Get-NinjaRmmDevices -DeviceID 528
PS C:\> $myComputer.System | Format-List

manufacturer       : Hewlett-Packard
name               : RECEPTION-PC
model              : HP Z400 Workstation
dns_host_name      : Reception-PC
bios_serial_number : 2UA1234567
serial_number      : 2UA1234567
domain             : WORKGROUP
```

### Alerts
You can get and reset alerts, too:
```powershell
PS C:\> $alertsToReviewLater = Get-NinjaRmmAlerts -Since 3071641

PS C:\> Reset-NinjaRmmAlert -AlertID 3071642
```

## After you're done
When you are finished, it is best practice to remove your API key from memory:
```powershell
PS C:\> Reset-NinjaRmmSecrets
```

## What else can I do?
There is plenty of help to read.  Get started with this:
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-Help about_NinjaRmmApi
```
